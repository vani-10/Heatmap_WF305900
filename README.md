Introduction:

The dataset contains Peptide, Protein, Intensity, retention time, and Peptide score.In addition it has PG column which is the uncorrected “p”value or score for the whole peptide.So there are 12655 rows and 197 columns of which 64 Intensity columns are our focus for now So the matrix we have now is 12655*64 data points.
